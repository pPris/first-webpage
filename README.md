# first-webpage
### Purpose
This is my attempt to practice whatever I've learnt online about CSS and HTML.
As I learn about different CSS properties and HTML syntax I will try to implement it into a test-webpage. 
The content of the webpage is possibly like a diary or a portfolio.

I am also using this to try to figure out how to use github.
